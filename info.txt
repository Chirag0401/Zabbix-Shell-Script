upload_tmp_dir = /secure/tmp_upload/path
Positive Impact: Securely stores temporary file uploads, reducing the risk of tampering or unauthorized access.
Negative if Not Implemented: Default temporary directories could be less secure, exposing files to risk.
Use Case: Defines a secure temporary directory for file uploads, isolating them from other parts of the system and reducing the risk of unauthorized access or manipulation.

Session Security Settings
Positive Impact: Enhances session security, preventing session hijacking and fixation attacks.
Negative if Not Implemented: Leaves sessions more vulnerable to attack, compromising user authentication.
Use Case: Enhances the overall security of user sessions, crucial for protecting user authentication and preventing session hijacking or fixation.

disable_functions = list_of_functions
Positive Impact: Disables potentially dangerous PHP functions, reducing the risk of their exploitation.
Negative if Not Implemented: Leaves risky functions available, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.
Use Case: Disables potentially harmful PHP functions that could be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code, conduct information disclosure, or perform unauthorized system operations.

soap.wsdl_cache_dir = /secure/dir
Positive Impact: Secures the SOAP cache directory, preventing unauthorized access.
Negative if Not Implemented: Default or insecure cache locations could be exploited for information disclosure.
Use Case: Secures the directory where SOAP WSDL caching occurs, preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of cached data.
