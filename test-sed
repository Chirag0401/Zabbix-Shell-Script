sudo sed -i 's|proxy=http://proxy1.patch.bcs.local:3128|new_line|' /etc/yum.conf This is working but what if there is no such line (old line) in /etc/yum.conf but still I want to append the new line in this file. How can I do that?
#!/bin/bash

OLD_LINE="proxy=http://proxy1.patch.bcs.local:3128"
NEW_LINE="new_line"
FILE="/etc/yum.conf"

# Check if the old line exists in the file
if grep -q "$OLD_LINE" "$FILE"; then
    # The old line exists, replace it
    sudo sed -i "s|$OLD_LINE|$NEW_LINE|" "$FILE"
else
    # The old line does not exist, append the new line
    echo "$NEW_LINE" | sudo tee -a "$FILE" > /dev/null
fi
